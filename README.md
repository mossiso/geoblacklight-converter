# Geoblacklight Scripts

First, run the clean script:

```
$ clean.sh
```

When you're done (and Solr is running)

```
$ post.sh
```

## Notes

Need to iterate over each `gmd:onLine` and create new derivative
records for each layer. Each record will need to have its metadata
massaged for titles, etc. Keywords will need to be removed...
